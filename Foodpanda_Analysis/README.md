SQL Code: 
```SQL
SELECT 
	age, 
    COUNT(*) AS total_users,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN churned = 'Active' THEN 1 END) AS total_inactive_users,

3. What is the **city with highest frequency order** ?

SQL Code:
 
```SQL
SELECT 
	city,
    CASE      # Case statement to create segments of frequency of order
    WHEN order_frequency >=20 THEN 'High Frequency'  
    WHEN order_frequency <10 THEN 'Low Frequency'
    ELSE 'Medium Frequency'
    END AS frequency_segment,
    COUNT(*) AS number_users
FROM foodpanda_review2
GROUP BY city, frequency_segment
ORDER BY frequency_segment ASC, number_users DESC
LIMIT 5;
